# readme.generator

## Description 

Welcome to the readme.generator! 
This project is aimed at developers who would like to generate a quick, yet professional, readMe for a new project! When the developer is prompted for information about their application repository, a high-quality professional READ.md will be generated with the entered title of their project. When the developer enters their project title, it will be displayed. When the developer enters a description, instructions, information about usage, contribution, etc - it will all be displayed in the generated read.md. The developer is able to choose their license which will display the badge near the top of the readme file, display Github username, display email address, and have corresponding links in the table of contents!
